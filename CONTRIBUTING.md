# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Original project](https://github.com/Vipeax/MSI-LED-Tool) from Vipeax, but seems to maintain it only by pull request,
  * Discord: https://discord.gg/2vq6cmH channel [#msi-led-control](https://discord.gg/2vq6cmH). Usualy here when I don't sleep.

## Testing

Any functionnality must have been tested on multiple hardware. Ask for testing on the Discord server if you don't have enough hardware to do it.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to MinDBreaK/MSI-LED-Control](https://github.com/MinDBreaK/MSI-LED-Control/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using tabs
  * We use C#
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
MinDBreaK, maintener
